# SCGMonitoring
This is a tool to monitor the data, used in the "Supply Chain Game".
It's not possible to edit the game configuration with this tool, it just shows the data so you can make decisions based on it.

## Used libraries
I'm not absolutely sure if i forgot a used library but I definitely used one:

- matplotlib (to display the data)

## Disclaimer
This tool has been implemented kind of in a rush, so obviously the code quality is absolutely not good.
To use it, some configurations have to be made inside the code (marked by a "TODO"), espacially the credentials of the team, names of other teams, the output paths for read data etc.
Feel free to implement more features to the tool, but as my university course is over, I will not implement any further features.
